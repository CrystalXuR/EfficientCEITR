# CEAOptimalITREfficient
This package is developed for the paper entitled "A Conditional Random Forest Approach to Estimating the Most Cost-effective Individualized Treatment Rule". This set of code applies a conditional random forest classification method to predict the optimal cost-effectiveness (CE) individualized treatment rule (ITR) so that the unbiased classification is guaranteed even when the predictors are in various types or are highly correlated. Furthermore, this code implements partitioned inverse probability weighting (IPW) and agumented IPW (AIPW) estimators to imrprove estimation accuracy and efficiency.
